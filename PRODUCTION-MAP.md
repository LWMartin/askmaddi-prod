# AskMaddi — Production Map

**Surveyed:** 2026-04-04 by Claude + Lee (PuTTY/WinSCP session)
**VPS:** server-606198.aisciencecenter.com (CentOS 7, cPanel)
**Domain:** askmaddi.com (Let's Encrypt SSL via `/etc/letsencrypt/live/askmaddi.com`)

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Browser (user)
    │
    ├── HTTPS ──→ Apache (cPanel) ──→ /home/askmaddi/public_html/
    │                                   Static files: index.html, js/, css/, images/
    │
    ├── /health, /instructions, /proxy, /ping
    │       │
    │       ├── Route A: Apache ProxyPass → Flask :5000 (direct)
    │       └── Route B: api.php → curl → Flask :5000 (PHP bridge)
    │
    └── Flask/Gunicorn (systemd: askmaddi.service)
            WorkingDirectory: /opt/askmaddi/gateway/
            Port: 5000, 2 workers, runs as root
            Running since: 2026-02-06 (nearly 2 months uptime)
```

**Dual routing:** Both Apache `ProxyPass` and `api.php` forward to Flask.
Likely from debugging — both work, `api.php` is the fallback if Apache
mod_proxy has issues. Can consolidate to ProxyPass-only after migration.

## File Locations

### Frontend — `/home/askmaddi/public_html/`

| File | Purpose | In repo? |
|------|---------|----------|
| `index.html` | Main page (5,176B, Feb 3) | YES but different — VPS has logo, affiliate disclosure, Impact meta tags |
| `css/maddi.css` | Stylesheet | YES but VPS has .bak/.bak2/.bak3/.bak4/.final/.final2 copies |
| `js/app.js` | Main app (7,855B) | YES but VPS version may differ (not diffed) |

## VPS vs Repo Drift

### Gateway app.py — TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS

**VPS (74L, production):**
- Has `flask-limiter` (30 req/min on `/proxy`)
- NO domain allowlist — open proxy to any URL
- NO headless fetcher import
- NO URL logging (privacy-correct)
- Health endpoint: simple `{status, manifests_loaded}`
- `load_manifests()` called at module level

**Repo (157L, never deployed):**
- NO rate limiting
- HAS domain allowlist via `endswith` (spoofable per security spec)
- HAS headless fetcher integration (Chrome not installed on VPS)
- Logs truncated URLs to stdout
- Health endpoint includes `headless_ready`
- Has `/instructions/<site>` endpoint (VPS doesn't)

**Resolution needed:** Merge the best of both. Rate limiting from VPS +
domain validation (fixed) from repo. Drop headless code until Chrome
is installed post-migration.

### Frontend index.html — VPS IS AHEAD

VPS additions not in repo:
- `<meta name="impact-site-verification" ...>` (two Impact affiliate tags)
- Affiliate disclosure bar: `<div class="affiliate-disclosure-bar">...</div>`
- Logo: `<img src="images/logo.png" ...>`
- Title: "AskMaddi.com - Private Product Search" (repo: "Ask Maddi")

### Files on VPS not in repo at all
- `mission.html` — brand/mission page
- `privacy.html` — privacy policy
- `terms.html` — terms of service
- `api.php` — PHP bridge to Flask
- `images/logo.png` — site logo
- `.htaccess` — PHP handler

## Runtime Environment

| Component | Version/Status |
|-----------|---------------|
| OS | CentOS 7 (EOL — migration to AlmaLinux 8 planned) |
| Python | 3.8.18 |
| Flask | via gunicorn (2 workers) |
| Chrome | **NOT INSTALLED** |
| PHP | 8.2 (ea-php82, cPanel managed) |
| Apache | 2.4 (cPanel managed) |
| SSL | Let's Encrypt (auto-renew via cPanel) |
| Process manager | systemd (`askmaddi.service`) |
| cPanel user | `askmaddi` (separate from `lwmpost`) |
| Service runs as | **root** (security issue — see hardening spec) |

## Apache Proxy Config

```apache
ProxyPreserveHost On
ProxyPass /health http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
ProxyPassReverse /health http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
ProxyPass /instructions http://127.0.0.1:5000/instructions
ProxyPassReverse /instructions http://127.0.0.1:5000/instructions
ProxyPass /proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy
ProxyPassReverse /proxy http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy
ProxyPass /ping http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping
ProxyPassReverse /ping http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping
```

## Affiliate Status

- **Amazon Associates:** Approved. Tag: `askmaddi-20`. **Wired in repo, needs deploy to VPS.**
- **eBay Partner Network:** Approved. Campaign ID: `5339138080`. **Wired in repo, needs deploy to VPS.**
- **Impact:** Two verification meta tags in index.html — likely for affiliate network onboarding.
- **Best Buy, Newegg, Walmart:** Denied (insufficient traffic).
- **API access:** None from any platform — headless scraping is the only path.
- **Revenue status:** ZERO — no affiliate codes are wired. Approved but not earning.

## AlmaLinux 8 Migration — What Must Survive

### Must preserve
1. `/home/askmaddi/public_html/` — entire frontend (including VPS-only files)
2. `/opt/askmaddi/gateway/` — production gateway code (74L version with rate limiting)
3. `/etc/systemd/system/askmaddi.service` — service unit (update User from root)
4. `/etc/apache2/conf.d/userdata/ssl/2_4/askmaddi/askmaddi.com/proxy.conf` — Apache proxy
5. SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt will re-issue on new box)
6. DNS records (`/var/named/askmaddi.com.db`)
7. cPanel user `askmaddi` and its configuration

### Must fix during migration
1. Stop running as root → dedicated `askmaddi` service user
2. Install Chrome/Chromium for headless fetching
3. Merge gateway app.py (rate limiting + domain validation)
4. Sync repo with VPS (pull VPS-only files into repo)
5. Upgrade Python (3.8 → 3.9+ on AlmaLinux 8)
6. Consolidate routing (ProxyPass only, drop api.php)

### Can discard
- All `.bak*`, `.final*`, `.jan27` files (archaeology — snapshot first)
- `api.php` after ProxyPass is confirmed working
- `/backup/` entries (cPanel handles its own backups)

## Specs (in phantom-ops repo)

| Spec | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `maddi-product-core-spec` | 1,024 | READY TO BUILD — Amazon catalog encoding |
| `maddi-security-hardening` | 1,087 | READY TO BUILD — 10 issues identified |
| `maddi-distribution-engine` | 782 | READY TO BUILD — automated daily pipeline |

## Next Actions

1. **Deploy affiliate codes to VPS** — Amazon (askmaddi-20) + eBay (5339138080) wired in repo, need to update VPS `affiliate.js`. Fastest path to revenue.
2. **Sync repo with VPS** — pull mission.html, privacy.html, terms.html, api.php, logo.png, live index.html, live app.py into repo
3. **AlmaLinux 8 migration** — use this map as the preservation checklist
4. **Install Chrome on new box** — unblocks headless scraping (Amazon)
5. **Merge gateway versions** — best of VPS (rate limiting) + repo (validation)
6. **Security hardening** — run through the 10-item checklist post-migration
7. **Add Amazon manifest** — gateway has bestbuy/ebay/newegg but no amazon.json
